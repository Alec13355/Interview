# Question Fizzbuzz
Please print number starting from 1 to 100. When a number is multiple of three, print “Fizz” instead of a number on the console and if multiple of five then print “Buzz” on the console. For numbers which are multiple of three as well five, print “FizzBuzz” on the console.

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.


# Question Frontend:
Project list-example is an angular project. We have today a simple todo app the allows you to add and remove items. You created this simple app to help you and have shared it with people at your company. It was such a success they want to implement it as a part of weekly manager 1 on 1s. The ask for you is before they roll it out they would like it to 
1) Have a button to clear all tasks (at the end of the week it might be cumbersome to delete everything manually)
2) Allow a completed status so you can see what's done at a glace
3) Have complete tasks go to the bottom of the list so only open TODOs are at the top

Feel free to pick whichever task you'd like to start with and we'll work until we run out of time. 

# Question TDD:

Amazon in 2016 announced a concept of delivery by drones. In this scenario they’ve outsourced their drone inventory system. Recently, that company has astronomically increased the costs of using their service. Problem: As the drones leave the hangars they are scanned when they return they are also scanned. Your role is to write an algorithm that given a list of integers can identify which drones are missing. (Sometimes pseudo code helps to do before kicking off)

We are going to step through the scenario above and implement it in code in a TDD like scenario. You have been provided a Dotnet project with the test cases commented out and a sample method. We will go test by test to ensure (in a TDD like scenario) we are writing just enough code to satisfy the tests and keeping it simple and readable.

There is a JSTDD and Dotnet

# Question (If Time Permits)
Create a JS file and a test file. We will walkthrough solving this problem https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1
