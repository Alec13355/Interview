# Question 1 Sudo Code:
Amazon drones

Amazon in 2016 announced a concept of delivery by drones. In this scenario theyâ€™ve outsourced their drone inventory system. Recently, that company has astronomically increased the costs of using their service. Problem: As the drones leave the hangars they are scanned when they return they are also scanned. Your role is to write an algorithm that given a list of integers can identify which drones are missing. 

Step 1 Create a Branch for your work.

# Question 2 TDD:
We are going to step through the scenario above and implement it in code in a TDD like scenario. You have been provided a JS project with the test cases commented out and a sample method. We will go test by test to ensure (in a TDD like scenario) we are writing just enough code to satisfy the tests and keeping it simple and readable.

# Question 3 (If Time Permits)
Create a JS file and a test file. We will walkthrough solving this problem https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1
