# Question 2 Sudo Code:
Amazon drones

Amazon in 2016 announced a concept of delivery by drones. In this scenario they’ve outsourced their drone inventory system.

Your role is to write an algorithm that given a list of integers can identify which drones are missing.

# Question 3 TDD:
We are going to step through the scenario above and implement it in code in a TDD like scenario. You have been provided a Dotnet project with the test cases commented out and a sample method. We will go test by test to ensure (in a TDD like scenario) we are writing just enough code to satisfy the tests and keeping it simple and readable.

# Question 4 (If Time Permits)
